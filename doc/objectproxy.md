  
  @example calculator_client.cpp
 
  This example is one part of three example applications that demonstrate
  client, server and watcher applications that use adapters and proxies
  generated by dbus-cxx-xml2cpp from a modified dbus introspection XML
  document.
 
  These three examples are:
  
  * @c calculator_server.cpp
  * @c calculator_client.cpp
  * @c calculator_watcher.cpp
  
 
  This particular piece is the client that uses the generated ObjectProxy
  derived class to call upon the calculator server to perform calculations.
 
  The client and watcher both use the same proxy generated from the XML
  document (see the calculator server example for the modified document).
 
  The proxy is generated with this command:
  @code
  dbus-cxx-xml2cpp --xml calculator.xml --proxy -f
  @endcode
 
  Here is the generated proxy file:
  @include xml2cpp/calculator/calculator_proxy.h
 
  And here is the client application:
  


  
  @example calculator_watcher.cpp
 
  This example is one part of three example applications that demonstrate
  client, server and watcher applications that use adapters and proxies
  generated by dbus-cxx-xml2cpp from a modified dbus introspection XML
  document.
 
  These three examples are:
  
  * @c calculator_server.cpp
  * @c calculator_client.cpp
  * @c calculator_watcher.cpp
  
 
  This particular piece is the watcher that uses the generated ObjectProxy
  derived class to observe calculation signals from the server.
 
  The client and watcher both use the same proxy generated from the XML
  document (see the calculator server example for the modified document).
 
  The proxy is generated with this command:
  @code
  dbus-cxx-xml2cpp --xml calculator.xml --proxy -f
  @endcode
 
  Here is the generated proxy file:
  @include xml2cpp/calculator/calculator_proxy.h
 
  And here is the watcher application:
 


  
  @example hal_proxy.cpp
 
  This is an example of an ObjectProxy generated by dbus-cxx-xml2cpp from a
  modified dbus introspection XML document.
 
  \par dbus-cxx-xml2cpp
 
  \par
  The command used to generate hal_manager_proxy.h from
  hal_manager_introspection.xml is:
  @code
  dbus-cxx-xml2cpp --xml hal_manager_introspection.xml --proxy -f --prefix="hal_"
  @endcode
 
  \par Modifying the DBus introspected XML
 
  \par
  dbus-cxx-xml2cpp uses a modified XML document obtained via introspection.
  In this example several attributes were added to the node tag and the
  introspection interface tag.
 
  \par
  The node tag was changed from this:
  @code
  <node>
  @endcode
  to this:
  @code
  <node gen-namespace="DBus::Hal" cppname="Manager" dest="org.freedesktop.Hal" path="/org/freedesktop/Hal/Manager" >
  @endcode
 
  \par
  The introspection interface tag had the @em ignored attribute added to
  prevent the interface from being built changing it from this:
  @code
  <interface name="org.freedesktop.DBus.Introspectable">
  @endcode
  to this:
  @code
  <interface name="org.freedesktop.DBus.Introspectable" ignored="1">
  @endcode
 
  \par Source xml
  Here is the modified xml document:
  @include xml2cpp/hal-proxy/hal_manager_introspection.xml
 
  \par Generated Proxy Object
  After running dbus-cxx-xml2cpp results in a .h file containing the definition
  of the proxy class. Here is the resulting hal_manager_proxy.h:
  @include xml2cpp/hal-proxy/hal_manager_proxy.h
 
  And finally, here is the example application that uses the proxy to watch for
  device added/removed signals.
 


  
  @defgroup proxy Proxy
 
  This group contains items that are of interest in creating local proxies
  for dbus objects, interfaces, methods and signals.
